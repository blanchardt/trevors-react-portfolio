          My name is Trevor Blanchard. I graduated from Manchester West High School in 2017.  I graduated in the top 20 percentile and 
          I was an honor student all 4 years of High School.  I was the first and only student in 2017 to graduate from Manchester West 
          High School with the New Hampshire Scholar, proficient in STEM. I was part of the First Robotics team all 4 years of High School, 
          in which I assisted with building and programming the robots.  I also learned CAD while working on the Robotics team.
