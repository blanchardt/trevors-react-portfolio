## Installation  
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:  

```  
npm install  
```  

## Usage  
In order to run the code, type ```npm run start``` in the base route of the directory.  This is my second portfolio.  There is an about me (or home), portfolio, contact, and a resume page.  The about me page gives some more info about me and has my picture on it.  The portfolio page contains links to my previous projects and the git hub repos for them.  The contact page provides a form to contact me by (not fully working yet) and contains my email address to guarantee you can get ahold of me through email.  The resume provides a link to download my resume and some information on what I have worked with recently.
